# Random-Forest-Fraud-prevention
# The main characteristics of Random Forest include:

Reduction of Overfitting: By combining multiple trees, Random Forest reduces the variability and overfitting found in individual decision trees.
Better Performance: In general, Random Forest tends to have better predictive performance than a single decision tree, especially in complex datasets.
Less Interpretability: Due to the ensemble nature of Random Forest, it is less interpretable than a single decision tree since it combines many trees.

# Disadvantages of Random Forest:

Complexity: The final model can be difficult to interpret due to the combination of many trees.
Training Time: It can be slower to train, especially with large datasets or many trees.
